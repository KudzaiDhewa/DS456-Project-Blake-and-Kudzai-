"Memory Safety & Robustness" (Category "cat")
Buffer Overflows/Overreads (memcpy bounds, off-by-one).
Resource Management (Memory leaks, unclosed files).
Pointer Errors (Null dereference, Use-After-Free, Double Free, dangling pointers).
Undefined Behavior (Integer overflows causing crashes, uninitialized memory).


"Concurrency & Thread Safety"
Data Races (Read/write without locking).
Locking Issues (Deadlocks, livelocks, improper mutex usage).
Atomics (Memory ordering, relaxed vs seq_cst).

"Logic & Correctness"
Algorithmic Errors (Math, sorting, wrong return values).
Validation (Input parsing that doesn't crash but is wrong).
Error Handling (Ignoring return codes like malloc failure).

"Build, Refactor & Internal"
Build System (Makefile, CMake, Configure).
Code Structure (Renaming, style, linting, moving files).
Deprecation (Updating to C99/C11 standards).

"Feature & Value Add"
New capabilities, APIs, or performance optimizations (not bug fixes).
