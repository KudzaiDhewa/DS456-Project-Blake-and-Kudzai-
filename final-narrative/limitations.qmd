 1. C is much more mature than Rust, making it challenging to find truly comparable libraries.

2.  Regressions to validate correlation between reduction in memory safety maintenance and increase in feature work are missing. This is an area for future exploration.
3.  LLM-based complexity score might not be the most accurate measurement approach as complexity is somewhat object and might vary from developer to developer.
